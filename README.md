kiteeatingtree.org is a website I'm getting going to share
things with family and friends and allow them to do the same.

TODO: (not prioritized, X = done)
    add information section to front page
    make user form error display not jump to top on error
    implement posts
    add posts to db
    display all posts
    display posts per user
    let user edit his posts
    implement picture sharing
    add password edit feature
    add send someone a private message
    add send a request to admin
    add email user/users feature
    X - Handle login/session
    X - add validated user to session
    X - check for validated user
    X - Add login decorator
    X - Fix when to show logged in as
    X - create user
    X - Add feedback on form submittal success for user/edit
    X - add sqlite db
    X - get schema going
    X - split home page into posts and info
    X - figure out envars
    X - fix where edit screwed up create
    X - edit user info

Future ideas for app:
    Maybe use OpenId and Flask-Login for user session and authentication
    Generalize everything, so that someone with little to no programming
        experience can create their family/group an instance of this
    maybe have design/stationery templates for emails/pages
